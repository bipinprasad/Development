        <p><b>Eclipse</b> is the development IDE of choice. It can be downloaded from the 
            http://www.eclipse.org. Download Eclipse Kepler (4.3.1) standard edition. 
            If you do not have Java installed on your machine, you will need to do that first. 
            Get JDK SE 7 (aka 1.7) from 
            <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">

        <p><b>Python Distribution</b> Download python version 2.7.6 32-bit version from 
            <a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/">python.org</a>. 
            There is a Windows x86 MSI Installer on this page. Skip the 64-bit because 
            of persistent issues with 64 bit third party libraries.

            <b>Source Code Control</b>: Source repository is github. URLs for various repos will be updated here. Before working on a git project, familiarize yourself with git, since it works quite differently from other source control software and is quite confusing with a lot of options. 
            
            Download GitHub GUI software from <a href="http://windows.github.com">http://windows.github.com</a>. You will
        <ul>
            <li>clone an existing remote (on the github) git project</li>
            <li>create and switch to a branch</li>
            <li>make changes and test code to the branch (local)</li>
            <li>add changed files and commit changes to branch (still locally)</li>
            <li>merge the change to the official branch</li>
            <li>push the changes to remote</li>
            <li>Note: Each of the actions above has a multi word git command, but the GUI interface makes it simpler.</li>
        </ul>
